    "content": "eClass Login OUR STORY Brief History Kwun Tong Maryknoll College is the third secondary school opened in Hong Kong by the Maryknoll Fathers, a society of Catholic priests and brothers founded in the United States in 1911. At that time there were only two \"Maryknollers\" - Father James A.Walsh and Father Frederick Price. They came together to start a missionary work which has since grown into a society of over a thousand priests, brothers and students dedicated to bringing the knowledge and love of God to the people of 18 countries around the world. The name \"Maryknoll\" comes from two words - \"Mary\" and \"knoll\". The first major seminary of the society was built on a small hill or \"knoll\" which was dedicated to Christ's Blessed Mother Mary; thus the name \"Mary's knoll\" later simplified to Maryknoll. The Maryknoll Fathers first came to South China in 1918 and one of the co-founders, Fr. Price, died in Hong Kong. At one time there were over 150 Maryknoll Fathers working in South China until their expulsion from the mainland in 1950. Now there are members of the society in Hong Kong serving in parishes, schools, welfare and social centres and working with factory employees and many other groups. The Maryknoll Fathers The Maryknoll Fathers began working in the Kwun Tong area in the late 1950s. At that time, the extensive reclamation project was in full swing with acres and acres of land being formed on the edge of Kowloon Bay. Factories and resettlement estates were going up as fast as the landfill sites were completed. The population of the area began to soar with consequent demand for religious, social and educational services. At first, rented quarters were used for religious and social activities. Then, with assistance from Government in the form of educational subsidies, primary schools were erected to meet the pressing need for schooling by the many students leaving primary. In anticipation of the opening of the new building, 207 boys were enrolled for Form 1 in September, 1971. The Divine Word Fathers of Sing Yin Secondary School in Lam Tin kindly made space available to us for one year. The opening of the new school building was delayed three weeks of the tragic landslide in the adjacent Sau Mau Ping hillside site, but we were able to take possession of the new building on 25th September, 1972 with an enrollment of 507 students up to Form 3 and a teaching staff of 19. The school was formally dedicated and blessed by Bishop Francis Hsu on 1st April, 1973. When fully staffed, the College will have 1,200 boys studying from Form 1 to Form 7, preparing graduates for entrance to the Hong Kong universities and overseas institutions. With 30 classrooms, 6 science laboratories, 4 special purpose rooms and a spacious school hall and outdoor ballcourts, the school is well equipped to provide the academic, physical, social and moral training which is the goal of education.

    "content": "eClass Login VISION & MISSION Emblem The symbol, or emblem of Kwun Tong Maryknoll College was designed by our first Supervisor, Rev. John Cioppa, M.M. using the symbol of the Maryknoll Father Society- the \"Chi-Rho\". These are two Greek letters: Chi written as \"X\" and Rho written as \"P\". These two letters are the first letters of the Greek work for Christ. The round figure, or oval, represents the globe or world for whom Christ came as Saviour. Thus the school's symbol shows its unity with the work of the Maryknoll Fathers in many countries throughout the world, the work of bringing Christ's love to all people and races. The Maryknoll Fathers hope that each student will honour the school emblem by leading a good, upright life and by being an instrument of God's love in a world that needs truth and love. Goals and Aims School Goals To provide students whole-person education; To deepen students' knowledge of the Chinese culture; To enable students to have reverence of God and love people through knowing Christ our Lord. School Educational Aims Virtue To encourage students to admire the truthfulness, goodness and beauty of God's creation; To cultivate their moral conscience and personality, enabling them to be self-disciplined, right-minded, and to foster a positive outlook on life. Intellect To develop the ability to think and learn independently; To increase the interest in learning through acquiring effective learning methods. Health To develop an interest in sports, to form good sports habits and adherence to rules; To raise the quality of the physique and the mind, so as to build a positive healthy image.

    "content": "eClass Login Speech from Principal 2024-2025 Good morning, Reverend Fung, teachers, and boys. Welcome back to KTMC for a vibrant and inspiring start to the year! As we commence the 2024-2025 academic year, your presence fills the campus with dynamic energy, making today's school opening most unique and memorable. To start off, let us extend a warm welcome to our new members of the teaching staff, who join us with great enthusiasm and expertise: • Mr. Peace Law, our English Language Teacher • Miss. Mimi Leung, our Chinese Language Teacher • Miss. Carmen Li, our Chinese Language Teacher • Miss. Mavis Li, our Chinese Language Teacher • Mr. Michael Mears, our Native English Teacher • Mr. Anthony Tsui, our Physical Education and Integrated Science Teacher Please join me in giving them all a hearty round of applause! Additionally, I am pleased to announce two important new appointments within our school leadership team for this academic year. First, Ms. Cathy Lo has assumed the role of Vice-Principal. Alongside her, Mr. Alick Yuen has been appointed as the Assistant Vice-Principal. Together, their leadership is set to enhance our educational environment and maintain the high standards that we value deeply. Congratulations! Turning to our academic achievements, we have seen a marked improvement in our students' performance. In the HKDSE last year, our students achieved a higher percentage of Level 5+ compared to all candidates sitting the examinations, in 13 out of 15 subjects. Specifically, we observed notably outstanding results in such electives as Economics, Geography, Information and Communication Technology, and Biology. Additionally, 80% of our students received degree offers through JUPAS, including one student admitted to the Bachelor of Arts and Sciences in Applied Artificial Intelligence at HKU through SNDAS, the School Nominations Direct Admission Scheme. Remarkably, one-third of our students gained admission to prestigious institutions including HKU, CUHK, and HKUST. Our boys were admitted to a wide variety of competitive programmes, including Medicine, Artificial Intelligence (there are quite a few of them), Bioinformatics, Actuarial Science, Data Science, Chinese Language Studies and Education, Music, etc. These admissions exhibit the efficacy of our high-quality teaching, as well as the hard work put in by both our teachers and students, truly highlighting the caliber of our academic endeavours and the mission that our school serves. This year, our guiding theme is drawn from Ephesians 3:17: \"Christ will make his home in your hearts through faith, and you may have your roots and foundation in love.\" This message not only inspires us to deepen our faith but also encourages us to rely on God as our foundation and guide in all we do. In cultivating a community rooted in love, we strengthen our bonds with each other and with God, ensuring that our actions reflect our spiritual commitments. By rooting our daily interactions and learning in these values, we create an environment that nurtures spiritual as well as intellectual growth. We are also excited to introduce our revised SHINE Programme framework, emphasizing our commitment to developing well-rounded individuals, i.e. all of YOU, through values such as Responsibility, Modesty, Empathy, Integrity, and Critical Thinking, to name a few. Each aspect of SHINE — Strengths Within Me, Harmony in Relationships, Influence in the Community, Navigating Towards Success, and Embracing Challenges — aims to cultivate not only academic excellence but also personal growth and community engagement. This year, we place significant emphasis on nurturing your values and moral development, stressing the discipline Maryknollers should demonstrate both inside and outside the school. Central to this is the core value of love — reflecting our reverence for God and our commitment to loving others. This is designed to foster a holistic education, ensuring that YOU are not only prepared to lead in school and in the broader community, but also embody the values that promote a compassionate society. As we move forward, let us embrace these values and strive to shine brightly in both our personal journeys and our collective endeavours. Let’s support each other, recognizing our shared responsibilities and collective strength. Facing this new year with optimism and faith, we trust in our abilities and in the guiding hand of Christ. May peace and God's blessings be with you all throughout this year. Thank you. 100 Tsui Ping Road, Kwun Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong (852) 2717 1485, (852) 2297 5300, Fax(852) 2727 2788 ktmc@ktmc.edu.hk Sitemap | Copyright ©2025 Kwun Tong Maryknoll College.

二零一七年七月四日會員大會修訂並通過生效 家長校董選舉章則 觀塘瑪利諾書院家長教師會(以下簡稱本會)，獲得觀塘瑪利諾書院(以下簡稱學校)法團校董會認可為辦理家長校董選舉的家教會之後，應依照本章則所載之選舉機制及程序進行觀塘瑪利諾書院法團校董會家長校董及替代家長校董選舉(以下簡稱有關選舉)： 候選人資格 1. 所有學校現有學生的家長，都有資格成為候選人。家長就學生而言，包括該學生的監護人及並非該學生的家長或監護人，但實際管養該學生的人。 2. 根據教育條例第40AO條第(5)(b)款，如有關家長是學校的在職教員，他/她便不能獲提名為家長校董。候選人請注意«教育條例»第30條所載有關校董的註冊規定。 3. 根據條例規定，校董不可在法團校董會內同時出任多於一個界別的校董。因此，任何人士均不可同時出任家長校董及校友校董。如兩個界別於同一時間在學校舉行選舉，候選人亦不可同時參選兩個界別的校董選舉。 人數和任期 4. 法團校董會在其章程內已訂明家長校董及替代家長校董的人數為各一名，而任期為兩年；由註冊為校董或替代校董的日期起計。為計算校董任期起見，如因註冊事宜而延至九月一日以後始就任，在其任期的首個學年內，任何不足十二個月期間均須視作完整的一年。家長校董只可以連任一次。舉行選舉後，本會將向法團校董會提名獲選的家長註冊為家長校董。否則，根據條例第40AU條，如家長校董的職位懸空超過三個月，法團校董會便須向常任秘書長申請延長填補該空缺的限期。 提名程序 選舉主任 5. 本會應委派一名選舉主任，監察有關提名、分發選票及點票工作。選舉主任可由本會的幹事互選或由學校委派一名教師擔任，但選舉主任本身不可以是家長校董選舉的候選人。 6.1 選舉主任須 於 選 舉 日 期 前 最 少25天 發信通知所有家長，有關家長校董選舉事項，其中包括家長校董的空缺數目、提名期限、提名方法、投票日期、點票會日期、公布結果日期及其他資料，亦應隨信附上提名表格。同時，選舉主任須在信中列明家長校董選舉的候選人資格和職責。 6.2 每名家長只可提名本人或另一名合資格的候選人參選，並 由 另 一 位 家長和 議 ， 和議人必須是現有學生的家長。 6.3 家長於收到選舉通知後，倘欲提名本人或另一名合資格家長參選，須於選舉舉行前最少18天，以書面形式向選舉主任提出，並由另一位家長和議。獲提名的家長須同時向選舉主任提供有關其個人資料的簡介（限100字內）予選舉主任處理。 6.4 每名獲提名家長的個人簡介中，須申報有否觸犯教育條例第30條所載有關常任秘書長可拒絕校董註冊的理由，以助投票人判斷他/她是否適合及適當的候選人。 6.5 倘於選舉舉行前18天，沒有家長獲提名參選，選舉主任須把提名期延長至選舉舉行前14天。 6.6 選舉主任須於選舉舉行前最少7天，確認參選家長的候選資格，並將候選家長校董的個人簡介、選舉安排及時間表發放予全體家長。本會應保障本身不會因刊登有關候選家長校董的個人簡介而涉及任何訴訟的法律責任。 6.7 倘於選舉舉行前14天，只有一名候選家長校董，則該名候選家長校董自動當選。 6.8 倘於選舉舉行前14天，仍沒有家長獲提名參選，選舉主任須宣布選舉程序終止，另擇日期重新進行選舉 投票人資格 7. 所有學校現有學生的家長均符合資格投票。學校教師只要是現有學生的家長，也有權投票。所有合資格投票的人士都享有同等的投票權。每名家長不論其就讀本校子女的數目，只可有一票，並以個人身分投票。父及母均享有投票權，如學生另有監護人或實際管養該學生的人，在其要求下，也可給予選票。 選舉程序 投票日期 8. 家長校董選舉的投票日期應與提名截止日期相距最少兩星期。 投票方法 9. 為確保選舉公平，投票應以不記名方式進行，即投票人不得在選票上寫上自己的姓名或任何可辨識身分的符號，亦不得讓其他投票人目睹他投票給哪一位候選人。選票樣本見附件二。 10. 校方應為選舉設置一個上鎖的投票箱，鎖匙由選舉主任保存。家長須於選舉日(可多於一天) 親自到學校投票，選舉主任會於最少7日前事先通知所有家長有關安排，並列出投票日期、時間和地點。 點票 11. 選舉主任須安排一個點票會，邀請所有家長、各候選人、及/或校長(或其代表)出席及見證點票工作。 12. 家教會主席、選舉主任或校長(或其代表)須參與點票見證工作。在點票期間，選舉主任應確保所有選票均已從投票箱倒出，才開始點票。如有以下情況，選票當作無效— 選票上所投的候選人數目，超逾認可數目； 選票填寫不當；或 選票加上可令人找出投票者身分的符號。 13. 如只有一個家長校董及一個替代家長校董空缺，獲得最多選票的候選人，將獲提名註冊為家長校董，而獲得第二最多選票的候選人，將獲提名註冊為替代家長校董。若兩個或以上候選人得票相同，會以抽簽決定。若只得一名候選人，該候選人會自動當選。 14. 選舉工作結束後，選舉主任應把所有已投的選票放入信封內。選舉主任和家教會主席須分別在信封面上簽署，然後把信封密封。信封和選票應由家教會保存最少六個月，以便在有人提出有關選舉不當的指控時，供調查之用。 公布結果 15. 選舉主任應在選舉後一個月內在學校網頁及家教會壁布版公布選舉結果。 16. 落選的候選人可在選舉結果公布的一星期內，以書面方式向本會提出上訴，並列明上訴的理由。本會將委任兩名未見證點票的家長及由本校校長委任一名未見證點票工作的教師為上訴委員處理上訴。如果需要重新點票，須邀請投訴人及所有候選人出席監察。上訴委員的決定為最終的決定。 選舉後跟進事項 17. 本會須向法團校董會提名獲選的家長，出任學校的家長校董。其後，法團校董會須向常任秘書長申請，將獲選的家長註冊為學校的校董。 填補臨時空缺 18. 若家長校董的子女在他/她的校董任期內不再是學校的現有學生，該校董的任期可持續至任期屆滿或該學年終結為止，兩者以較早者為準。 19. 如家長校董在任期內離任，出現空缺，本會須以同樣方式在三個月內進行補選，填補有關的空缺。如本會無法於該段期間進行補選，則法團校董會可基於充分理由，向常任秘書長申請將填補有關空缺的時限再繼續延長。 注意事項 20. 本會主席不可自動當選為家長校董，獲選的家長校董亦不會自動當選為本會主席。 21. 作為家長校董選舉的候選人及投票人，家長須留意載於附件三的道德操守，以確保選舉的公平。 22. 常任秘書長接獲學校校董註冊的申請後，須進行他認為需要的探究，並可以«教育條例»第30條規定的理由拒絕申請人註冊為本校的校董。 《教育條例》 有關家長校董選舉的規定 規定 內容 30 如常任秘書長覺得有以下情況，可拒絕申請人註冊為某間學校的校董— 申請人每年最少有9個月不在香港居住； 申請人並非出任校董的適合及適當人選； 申請人的准用教員許可證以前曾被取消； 申請人未滿18歲； 申請人年滿70歲而無法出示有效的醫生證明書，以證明他在健康方面適合執行校董的職能； 申請人未滿70歲，而他在常任秘書長提出要求後，無法出示有效的醫生證明書，以證明他在健康方面適合執行校董的職能； 申請人在提出以下任何申請時，即－ (i) 學校註冊； (ii) 註冊為校董或教員；或 (iii) 僱用校內准用教員， 或在與該等申請有關的事項中，作出虛假的陳述或提供虛假的資料，或因在要項上有所遺漏而屬虛假； 申請人是《破產條例》(第6章)所指的破產人，或已根據該條例訂立自願安排； 申請人曾在香港或其他地方被裁定已犯可判監禁的刑事罪行；或 申請人已註冊為五間或以上的學校校董。 40AB 「教員」是指受僱於學校的准用教員或檢定教員，而他是受僱在學校— 擔任某個在小學資助則例、中學資助則例或特殊學校資助則例所規定的職員編制之內的教員職位；或 於一段為期不少於12個月的期間內，執行教學職責或其他直接與教學有關的職責。 40AL 設有法團校董會及一個認可的家教會的學校，須設有最少一名家長校董。 如學校屬上下午班制，而上、下午班分別有一個認可的家教會，則上、下午班須分別設有最少一名家長校董。 如學校只設有一名家長校董，須設有一名替代家長校董。如學校屬上下午班制，而上、下午班分別只有一名家長校董，則上、下午班須分別設有一名替代家長校董。 40AO 法團校董會可承認一個團體為認可的家教會，惟其章程必須列明只有下述的人士方可選出或出任該團體的幹事— 該校的現有學生家長；或 該校的現職教員註二。 家長校董及替代家長校董選舉須由該校的認可家長教師會舉行。 認可家教會可提名有關學校的法團校董會的章程所規定數目的人士，註冊為該校的家長校董或替代家長校董。 選舉制度須是公平而開放透明的。 候選人必須為現有學生的家長。 候選人不得是該校的教員。 在該選舉中，所有家長須擁有均等的投票權及參選權。 該選舉須以不記名方式進行投票。 40AS 家長校董及替代家長校董須以相同方式選出供提名以註冊為校董。 40AU 填補家長校董空缺人士的提名方式必須與停止擔任有關職位的校董的提名方式相同。 40AV 如家長校董不再是該校現有學生的家長，他的校董任期將持續至任期屆滿或該學年終結為止，兩者以較早者為準。 40AX 如學校的認可家教會認為某家長校董不適宜繼續擔任校董，可用類似選出該校董的方式通過決議，向法團校董會提出書面要求，取消該家長校董的註冊。當接獲有關要求後，法團校董會須向常任秘書長發出書面通知，要求取消該名家長校董的註冊。 註二：「教員」的定義須按照第40AB條的釋義。就特殊學校而言，「教員」的釋義在此並不包括「專責人員」。 Our Community Parent-Teacher

Organized as a cross-subject event by the Chinese panel, Chinese history panel, Putonghua panel, and Science panel, the first part, \"National Essence Cultural Study,\" showcased an impressive explanation of face-changing (變臉), accompanied by performances and interactive sessions. Students were captivated by the artistry and skill of performer Wang Sifu, praising his mastery. The second part included a variety of booth games, such as face-painting, lantern riddles, lion dancing, and a school-based Hanfu photo booth. Students enjoyed hands-on experiences with paper-making, dragon beard candy, and even crafted their own bows and arrows. Through these activities, students not only had fun but also gained a deeper understanding of Chinese culture. Overall, it was a delightful day of cultural exploration and appreciation for all participants.

This event was not only an exploration of religious culture but also a profound exchange among Maryknollers. During the visit to the Resurrection Parish, Sister Sue Glass MM provided the students with an in-depth explanation of the historical and cultural significance of this sanctuary. Through Sister Sue's narrative, the students learned about the importance of the Resurrection Parish in local history and its significant in the development of the Maryknoll community. After visiting the Resurrection Parish, student representatives from Kwun Tong Maryknoll College led the students from Maryknoll Convent School to visit several religious features on campus, including the Statue of Jesus, a mosaic mural, and an oil painting mural. These religious features reflect the school's deep-rooted religious culture and allowed the visiting students to feel the spirit and traditions of Maryknollers. This 'journey to trace the root' aimed to allow Maryknollers to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the culture of the Maryknoll community as well as their own identity. The exchange did not only strengthen the bonds and the sense of the community among students from both schools, it also paved the way for more opportunities for the Maryknoll community to connect with each other. https://jy.catholic.org.hk/node/detail/7436/ Back 100 Tsui Ping Road, Kwun Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong (852) 2717 1485, (852) 2297 5300, Fax(852) 2727 2788 ktmc@ktmc.edu.hk Sitemap | Copyright ©2025 Kwun Tong Maryknoll College.
